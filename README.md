    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    
    ## Overview
    
    I am a master’s student at the University of Science and Culture, majoring in Data Science. I am interested in doing research on the cutting-edge applications of Deep Learning, particularly in Computer Vision, and I'm currently working on Few-Shot object detection for my thesis. Also, I am collaborating with a group of researchers on an article titled 'Real-time facial emotion recognition with EfficientNetV2' which by a thorough contribution to preparing and writing the article, it allowed me to build a deep understanding of the context.
